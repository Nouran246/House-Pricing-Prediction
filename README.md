# 🏡 Housing Prices Prediction using Machine Learning

A regression-based machine learning project designed to predict housing prices based on various property features. This project follows a complete ML pipeline including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation.

## 📌 Overview

This project was developed as part of a university machine learning assignment with the goal of building an accurate house price prediction model. It involves:

- Handling missing data
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature scaling and selection
- Training multiple regression models
- Hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search and Random Search
- Plotting learning curves to detect underfitting/overfitting
- Final evaluation using RMSE, MAE, and R² Score

## 🧠 Model Highlights

- **Algorithms Used**: Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Grid Search & Random Search  
- **Evaluation Metrics**: RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), R² Score  
- **Learning Curve**: Visualized training and validation loss to assess model performance  
- **Test-Time Functionality**: A modular prediction function is ready for unseen test data provided during discussion
